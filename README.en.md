Switch models and adjust reasoning effort below the DSH composer, with an eight-frame Big Fat Fish runner that speeds up as you drag. Levels come from the selected model, and selections stay synchronized with `/model`.

- **Model-defined levels** — adapts to their count, names, and order; failed updates roll back.
- **Native appearance** — dark and light themes, with Simplified Chinese and English following DSH's active language immediately.
- **Optional motion** — the runner is on by default, with a plain-thumb option and reduced-motion support.
- **Custom-model guidance** — copy a configuration snippet, or one-click copy a whole brief for an agent to diagnose and fill in.

## What's new in v0.7.3

- Adapt to the settings API in DSH `0.1.7-rc.1`, restoring Host activation in the Web Profile.
- Use the configuration document and model location reported by the active Host. Copied snippets now match the indentation of legacy `settings.yaml` or the newer profile patch.
- Retain the legacy RC settings path.

See the [v0.7.3 release notes](https://github.com/HanaAyane/dsh-reasoning-effort/releases/tag/v0.7.3) and [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Version support policy

This plugin targets relatively stable **DSH RC versions** for compatibility work, testing, and bug fixes. **Individual alpha versions are not maintained.** During alpha development, client APIs, dependencies, and plugin loading may undergo frequent breaking changes. Supporting multiple transitional versions increases maintenance costs and makes compatibility difficult to sustain.

The current release is **plugin `v0.7.3`**, targeting **DSH `0.1.7-rc.1` (Web Profile)**. If you need an alpha version, maintain a temporary adaptation yourself. RC means release candidate; it does not imply automatic compatibility with every past or future RC.

| Item | Current status |
| --- | --- |
| Plugin release | [v0.7.3](https://github.com/HanaAyane/dsh-reasoning-effort/releases/tag/v0.7.3) |
| Target DSH version | DSH `0.1.7-rc.1`, Web Profile |
| Upgrade notes | Install `v0.7.3`, then restart the Web Host manually and refresh the page |
| Alpha versions | No separate adaptations; patch locally or switch to the target RC |

## Install and update

### 1. Install a pinned release

Run these commands in the terminal environment you use to start DSH:

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web add github:HanaAyane/dsh-reasoning-effort#v0.7.3
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Confirm that the output includes `name: dsh-reasoning-effort`. Use the same `add` command to update an existing installation. To try development changes, replace `#v0.7.3` with `#main`; the main branch may contain unreleased changes.

<details>
<summary>Ask an agent to install it: copy this prompt</summary>

```text
Install dsh-reasoning-effort v0.7.3 for the DeepSeek Harness web profile.
Run only these two commands and do not change any other profile:
dsh plugin --profile web add github:HanaAyane/dsh-reasoning-effort#v0.7.3
dsh --profile web --dump-config
Confirm that dsh-reasoning-effort appears in the configuration and report the result.
Do not stop or restart the running DSH process. Remind me to restart the Web Host and refresh the page manually.
```

</details>

### 2. Restart and refresh

The plugin loads when the Web Host starts. After installation, restart the DSH Web Host manually and refresh the page.

### 3. Choose a model and effort level

Open a session and click the model control below the composer. Drag the thumb or click the track; release to snap to the nearest valid level. Click the model row below it to expand the model list.

## Where the levels come from

The slider reads `reasoning.efforts` from the current model in DSH's model directory. The model and route determine the count, names, and order. Levels are not fixed to three steps and can differ between endpoints.

The slider appears when at least two levels are available; otherwise the menu shows a notice. DSH validates and dispatches the selected value, so the plugin cannot bypass model or deployment limits.

## Declaring levels for any custom model

This section is vendor-neutral and applies to every model you declare yourself under `llm-pi-ai`.

**Why the levels are missing**: DSH's model directory only reports what the adapter declares. A model you declare has no catalog entry, so the directory exposes no levels — and no slider — until you write `reasoningEfforts`.

**What to write**: open the configuration file shown in the guidance panel (older builds use `settings.yaml`; DSH `0.1.7-rc.1` uses the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`). Add `reasoningEfforts` under the model's `llm-pi-ai` entry, matching its existing indentation. Each key is a DSH level, each value is the spelling the endpoint accepts, and a level left out counts as unsupported:

```yaml
models:
  - id: <your model id>
    reasoningEfforts:
      low: "<value the endpoint accepts>"
      high: "<value the endpoint accepts>"
```

**When to add `compat`** (beside `reasoningEfforts`, only when the endpoint needs it):

| Endpoint behaviour | What to add |
| --- | --- |
| expresses effort directly through `reasoning_effort` | nothing |
| needs its thinking switch turned on first | `compat.thinkingFormat`: `"qwen"` (sends `enable_thinking`) / `"zai"` / `"deepseek"` |
| does not accept `reasoning_effort` | `compat.supportsReasoningEffort: false` |
| fails with 400 `invalid_parameter_error` | `compat.supportsDeveloperRole: false` |
| fails while replaying history | `compat.requiresReasoningContentOnAssistantMessages: true` |
| does not reason at all | `reasoningEfforts: false` |

With no `compat`, the adapter decides from the endpoint address: an address it does not recognize is treated as standard OpenAI, and a recognized vendor endpoint gets that vendor's format automatically. **Guessing the format is worse than leaving it out.**

**How to verify**: open the model menu after saving — the slider appearing means it worked. If the slider appears but requests fail, work through the table above. The plugin's built-in knowledge entries are shortcuts, not a requirement.

## Effort guidance for custom providers

Built-in routes get their levels from the pi-ai catalog and the plugin never touches them. Only models you declare yourself in `llm-pi-ai` receive guidance:

1. Open the model menu. If the current model is your own declaration and the directory exposes no levels (or the declaration disagrees with the knowledge base), a **View declaration guidance** entry appears.
2. The panel shows suggested levels (from the knowledge base or a generic template), YAML indented for the active configuration file, its path, and the model entry location.
3. Follow the panel's replace or insert instruction for the matching `- id:` entry, preserve other configuration, and save. DSH reloads automatically; if not, restart the Web Host and refresh.

Models the knowledge base does not know get a generic template you can edit directly. When a gateway rejects requests for a reason the template cannot express — an endpoint refusing the `developer` message role, for instance — the panel names the matching `compat` switch (`supportsDeveloperRole: false`).

If you would rather not fill it in yourself, or the declaration still fails, press **Copy for your agent** beside the panel: it puts a single brief on the clipboard — the observed facts (route, model id, active configuration file, entry line, levels the directory reads, knowledge-base suggestion, endpoint caveat), your task, the complete declaration rules, and a starting snippet. Paste it into a coding agent so it can read the target file, check the endpoint documentation, complete the configuration, and explain the result.

<details>
<summary>Advanced: extend the plugin knowledge base</summary>

The built-in entries cover only a few models, purely to save typing. With DSH `0.1.7-rc.1`, add `entries` under `config` in the existing `id: reasoning-effort` profile row. With older RCs, add them under `dsh-reasoning-effort` in `settings.yaml`. This example shows relative content; keep the indentation of the containing row. User entries win over built-ins:

```yaml
entries:
  - id: my-model
    provider: "*"          # provider route, * wildcard
    model: "my-model-id"   # model id, * wildcard
    note: description
    efforts:               # display level -> wire value the endpoint accepts
      low: "low"
      high: "high"
      max: "max"
    # compat:              # only when the endpoint needs a fixed format
    #   thinkingFormat: "qwen"
    #   supportsReasoningEffort: false
```

A `compat` block is copied into the generated snippet **verbatim**, so fill it in only when the endpoint really needs a fixed format: with none, the adapter decides from the endpoint address (an unrecognized address is treated as standard OpenAI, a recognized vendor gets that vendor's format), and a wrong format overrides that correct decision. On a protocol that does not take the field (e.g. `anthropic-messages`) the pasted entry makes the whole route fail to resolve.

The plugin only provides snippets — it never writes configuration, and catalog-declared level sets (even a single level) are never flagged.

## The Big Fat Fish slider

The eight-frame runner is **enabled by default**. To switch back to the plain white thumb:

1. Open **Settings → General**.
2. Find **Big Fat Fish slider** below Appearance.
3. Disable it and return to the model control.

<img src="assets/readme/settings.webp" alt="The reasoning effort and Big Fat Fish slider switches in DeepSeek Harness General Settings" width="100%">

The runner changes only the thumb artwork. Snapping, keyboard control, radiation effects, and model selection remain unchanged. It animates faster while dragging and freezes on a stable frame when reduced motion is enabled.

The **Reasoning effort selector** switch on the same page disables the complete enhancement without uninstalling it. DSH's built-in model selector returns immediately. Both preferences stay in the current browser.

## Troubleshooting

### The slider does not appear

Check that:

1. Check the running version with `dsh --version`; plugin `v0.7.3` targets DSH `0.1.7-rc.1`.
2. You restarted the DSH Web Host after installation.
3. **Settings → General → Reasoning effort selector** is enabled.
4. The selected model exposes at least two effort levels in the DSH model directory (see the next entry for models without any), and thinking is not disabled by the deployment.

### A model declares no effort levels

First check **View declaration guidance** in the model menu. For manual configuration, use the file path shown in the panel and the current model and endpoint documentation to fill in that entry's `reasoningEfforts` and `compat`. Do not reuse another model's levels or context limits without checking them.

The knowledge base provides guidance; the endpoint determines accepted values. If saving does not take effect, restart the Web Host and refresh the page.

### Report a problem on an RC version

Open an [issue](https://github.com/HanaAyane/dsh-reasoning-effort/issues) with your DSH version, plugin version, client type (Web or desktop wrapper), reproduction steps, and relevant console errors. Remove tokens and credentials before posting.

### Confirm that the plugin loaded

```powershell
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

The output should contain `name: dsh-reasoning-effort`.

### Uninstall

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-reasoning-effort
```

Restart the DSH Web Host afterward. The native model selector will return automatically.

## Development

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm run check
pnpm pack
```

Use Node.js `22.19+` (also meeting the target DSH requirements) and `pnpm@11.7.0`. `pnpm run check` validates TypeScript and locale dictionaries, then rebuilds the host entry, browser module, and type declarations. See [design/visual-spec.md](design/visual-spec.md) for the complete interaction contract and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.
